# Danske_task1

## Goal
Determine if user can reach the last element on a given positive/negative numbers set, according to these rules:  
* You start at first element.  
* Current element value indicates how many steps you can take at most. Example: if the value is 3 you can take 0, 1, 2 or 3 steps). Winnable example: **1**, **2**, 0, **3**, 0, 2, **0**. Not winnable example: **1**, **2**, 0, **1**, 0, 2, 0.  

## Features
* User should be able to adjust numbers.
* User should receive feedback if last element is reachable.
* Provide the most efficient way if last element is reachable.

## Technologies
Plain HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS were used in this project.

## Notes
At the moment function doesn't check for empty or text input and console will display error if empty or text will be submitted. However if text mixed with numbers will be submitted, only numbers will be used.
